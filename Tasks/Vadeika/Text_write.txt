The  February  TIOBE  Index  of  the
most  popular  programming languages
out,  and while the work going on in
background  of  TIOBE’s calculations
changed,  not  much  has  shifted in
the    way    of    rankings.
Python
to  sit  atop  the index, with C and
directly  behind  it.  In Feb. 2021,
three  also  occupied  the top spot,
with  Python  in  the  number  three
position,  C  at  top,  and  Java in
place.
Beyond  the  top three, there
much  movement  in  the  index, with
positions    four    through   eight
the   same  time  last  year.  Those
slots  are  occupied,  respectively,
by    C++,    C#,    Visual   Basic,
JavaScript  and  PHP. Positions nine
swapped  from  Feb.  21 to now, with
Language  and SQL now occupying each
positions.
The  one big move of note
2021  and  Feb.  2022  was  with the
programming       language,       an
language  for  Java. Over the course
year,    Groovy   fell   from   12th
position   all   the  way  to  20th,
perilously   close   to  the  “other
languages”   list.
TIOBE   CEO  Paul
attributes  Groovy’s  decline to the
the  CI/CD  space.  Groovy  was  the
only   language   used  for  writing
on  Jenkins,  which Jansen describes
having  been  “the  only real player
in  the CI/CD domain” early on. Now,
with  platforms  that  don’t require
Groovy,  like  GitHub,  Azure DevOps
GitLab,  Groovy  is losing its place
table.
“Groovy   could   have  grown
was     the    major    script-based
for  Java  running  on the same JVM.
However,  Kotlin is taking over that
right  now,  so  I think Groovy will
hard  time,”  Jensen said.
The TIOBE
may  not  be  full of surprises this
month,  but Jansen did have a lot to
about  the  index itself this month,
this  is  the first time it has been
compiled  using Similarweb’s traffic
platform  instead of Alexa.
“We have
Similarweb  for  the first time this
select     search     engines    and
there  are  no  big  changes  in the
to  this  swap.  The  only  striking
difference   is   that   the  top  3
Python,  C,  and  Java,  all  gained
more   than   1   percent   in   the
Jansen  said.
TIOBE  decided to make
switch  this  month  after  Amazon’s
announcement  in  December 2021 that
shutting   the   Alexa  web  ranking
effective  May  1,  2022,  ending 25
program.
Jansen   noted   that   not
every  website  has  been onboarded,
that   the   switch   to  Similarweb
switch  to using HtmlUnit, a non-GUI
browser  with  APIs  that  let  Java
apps  invoke  pages,  fill forms and
do   other   standard  web  browsing
activity.     This    switch    will
TIOBE  to  include  websites  it was
to      crawl      before,      like
Stackoverflfow   and  Github,  which
larger impact on scores.
